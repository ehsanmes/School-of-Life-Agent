<p>There are few things so universally experienced in life, and at the same time, so debilitating, than feelings of anxiety. Certain situations seem to provoke it very badly. Lying on the sofa, late on a Sunday evening, for instance, thinking about the many obstacles that must be climbed once the alarm clock sounds the next day.</p>
<p>It can manifest as a sudden sense of airlessness, a feeling that something is not quite right. And because it can be so hard to understand what exactly is going on, within our minds, to create this sense of dread, it can leave us feeling even more powerless.</p>
<p>Freud once described anxiety as: “a riddle whose solution would cast a flood of light upon our whole mental existence.” Understanding anxiety, its roots in the mind and the body, is the only way to begin to address it. Below are five recommendations for how to handle anxiety, at work and elsewhere: beginning with long-term recommendations to help think about anxiety, before moving onto simpler, practical tips for the everyday.</p>

<p>The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard famously compared anxiety – in typically grandiose terms – to the “dizziness” experienced by someone “whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss”.</p>
<p>This is a very elaborate way of saying that most people get a pang of vertigo when they look over the side of a tall building or cliff, but it helped to establish something important about why someone might suddenly feel so nervous and full of dread.</p>
<p>For Kierkegaard, anxiety is a fact of life. It is the price everyone must pay for possessing the freedom to act and make their own decisions. A person feels dizzy when looking over a ledge, he argued, because – deep down – they are forced to recognise that they have the freedom to do as they please, even something as awful as harming themself.</p>
<p>Freedom is often frightening. Being solely accountable for all the thousands of decisions made in an average month can quickly become overwhelming if we think about it for too long. But the good news is that this is far from unusual. Everyone experiences those feelings of panic and uncertainty. And even more importantly, it can be a spur to action. Those unpleasant feelings, so long as they don’t overwhelm us, can be a reminder of our own potential in the world. That we have the power to choose
